# Boston House Dataset-Regression

`This project applies basic machine learning concepts on data collected for
housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a
new home.`

In this we are going to use three diffrent Regression Models:

- [Linear Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html)
- [Random Forest Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html)
- [Lasso Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Lasso.html)

`Missing Attribute Values: None`

## Linear Regression

`Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable.
For example, a modeler might want to relate the weights of individuals to their heights using a linear regression model.
Before attempting to fit a linear model to observed data, a modeler should first determine whether or not there is a relationship between the variables of interest. This does not necessarily imply that one variable causes the other (for example, higher SAT scores do not cause higher college grades), but that there is some significant association between the two variables.`

## Random Forest Regression

`A Random Forest is an ensemble technique capable of performing both regression and classification tasks with the use of multiple decision trees and a technique called Bootstrap Aggregation, commonly known as bagging.

The basic idea behind this is to combine multiple decision trees in determining the final output rather than relying on individual decision trees. If you want to read more on Random Forests, I have included some reference links which provide in depth explanations on this topic.`
